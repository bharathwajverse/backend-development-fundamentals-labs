# Security Policy

## 1. Supported Scope

This repository maintains academic lab implementations for the **Backend Development Fundamentals** coursework. Security defenses demonstrated herein represent core web application safety fundamentals:

| Component | Protection Mechanism | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **SQL Database Operations** | Parameterized SQL Queries (`?` placeholders) | Active (`lab-02`) |
| **Environment Variables** | Secret exclusion via `.gitignore` (`.env`, `.env.local`) | Active (All labs) |
| **Dependencies** | Dependency isolation and lockfiles (`package-lock.json`) | Active (All labs) |
| **CORS Policy** | Whitelist / Origin isolation via `cors` middleware | Active (`lab-03`–`lab-10`) |
| **Payload Parsing** | Body parser byte limit protection via Express built-ins | Active (All labs) |

## 2. Defensive Coding Practices

### SQL Injection Prevention
In `lab-02`, database operations interact with SQLite. To prevent SQL injection:
- String interpolation (e.g. `` `SELECT * FROM book WHERE id = ${id}` ``) is strictly prohibited.
- Parameterized queries with `?` placeholders are used across all read, insert, update, and delete queries:
  ```javascript
  const getBookQuery = `SELECT * FROM book WHERE id = ?;`;
  const book = await db.get(getBookQuery, [bookId]);
  ```
- The SQLite query engine compiles the SQL command structure independently before parameter values are bound, ensuring user inputs are treated solely as literal data.

### Environment Variable & Secret Protection
- Never commit `.env` files or API secrets to the repository.
- Each laboratory directory contains a dedicated `.gitignore` that excludes `.env`, `node_modules`, and debug log files.
- The root directory also maintains a recursive `.gitignore` rule (`**/.env`) as defense-in-depth.
