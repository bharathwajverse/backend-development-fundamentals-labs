# Lab 07: Authentication & Security Architecture Foundation

## Lab Details

- **Lab Number:** 07
- **Subject:** Backend Development Fundamentals
- **Academic Context:** Year II, Term II
- **Module:** Authentication, Token Verification, and Backend Security
- **Implementation Status:** Starter Scaffold / Baseline Express Application

## Student Details

## 1. Overview & Implementation Scope

Lab 07 establishes the architectural baseline for secure backend communication, covering token-based authentication workflows, authorization guard middleware, and HTTP header hardening.

> **Implementation Notice:** In the current repository state, this lab contains the baseline architectural scaffold. The basic server infrastructure and operational endpoints are active, while JWT/session token verification and password hashing pipelines remain scaffolded for upcoming coursework.

## 2. Technologies Used

- **Runtime:** Node.js (v18.x / v20.x)
- **Framework:** Express.js (`^5.3.0`)
- **Middleware:**
  - `cors` (`^2.8.6`)
  - `dotenv` (`^18.0.9`)
- **Development Tool:** Nodemon (`^3.1.14`)
- **API Testing:** VS Code REST Client (`lab-07.http`)

## 4. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm (v9.x or later)

### Steps
Navigate to the `lab-07` directory and install dependencies:

```powershell
cd lab-07
npm install
```

---

## 5. Running the Application

### Development Mode (auto-restart)
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Standard Execution
```powershell
npm start
```

### Server Port Configuration
The server initializes on port **5002** by default:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5002;
```
If a `.env` file is present specifying `PORT=3000`, the server will bind to port 3000 instead.

---

## 6. Implemented API Endpoints

The following endpoints are verified to exist in `server.js`:

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description | Content-Type | Status Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GET** | `/` | Returns welcome status and ISO timestamp | `application/json` | `200 OK` |
| **GET** | `/api/health` | Returns service health status and process uptime | `application/json` | `200 OK` |
| **ALL** | `/*` | Centralized catch-all 404 handler | `application/json` | `404 Not Found` |

### Audit Notice: Unimplemented Routes
Any routes previously documented as `/about` or `/time` are **not implemented** in this lab's `server.js` and will return the standard 404 JSON response:
```json
{
  "error": "Route not found"
}
```

---

## 7. Request and Response Examples

### 1. Root Service Check
- **Request:** `GET http://localhost:5002/`
- **Response Status:** `200 OK`
- **Response Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Welcome to lab-07 Backend API",
    "status": "online",
    "timestamp": "2026-11-01T17:48:00.000Z"
  }
  ```

### 2. Health & Uptime Inspection
- **Request:** `GET http://localhost:5002/api/health`
- **Response Status:** `200 OK`
- **Response Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "OK",
    "uptime": "104s",
    "timestamp": "2026-11-01T17:48:00.000Z"
  }
  ```

### 3. Route Not Found
- **Request:** `GET http://localhost:5002/non-existent-route`
- **Response Status:** `404 Not Found`
- **Response Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Route not found"
  }
  ```

## 8. Testing with REST Client

A test suite is provided in [`lab-07.http`](./lab-07.http):
> **Port Configuration Notice:** The `@baseUrl` variable in `lab-07.http` defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. If running without a `.env` override, update `@baseUrl` to `http://localhost:5002` or provide a `.env` file setting `PORT=3000`.

## 9. Verification & Screenshots Status

- **Screenshots Directory:** No screenshot files currently exist in `lab-07`.
- **Status:** Screenshots are pending assignment progression and feature implementation.

## 10. Viva Voce Preparation

### Q1: What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
> **Answer:** Authentication verifies *who* the user is (e.g., verifying credentials and issuing a JWT). Authorization verifies *what* permissions the authenticated user possesses (e.g., whether an authenticated standard user can delete another user's resource).

### Q2: Why should passwords never be stored in plain text or using fast hash algorithms like MD5/SHA-256?
> **Answer:** Fast hashing algorithms are vulnerable to modern GPU-based brute-force and rainbow table attacks. Passwords must be hashed using adaptive, compute-intensive key derivation functions with cryptographic salt (such as bcrypt or Argon2) to resist offline attacks.

### Q3: What is the purpose of the HTTP `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header?
> **Answer:** The Bearer scheme conveys an access token (such as a JSON Web Token) to authenticate HTTP requests without transmitting username and password on each invocation. The server verifies token signature, expiry, and claims before executing protected handlers.

## 11. Conclusion

Lab 07 maintains an Express API skeleton equipped with CORS isolation, JSON body handling, and health inspection primitives ready for authentication layer integration.
